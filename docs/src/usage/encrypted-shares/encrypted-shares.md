# Encrypted Shares

Encrypted shares offer an extra layer of seed protection by encrypting the share data after the Shamir splitting has been completed.

This can be done in two ways:

1. With a [generated key](./generated-key/generated-key.md), which is the most secure but requires the generated key to be stored safely.
2. A memorable passphrase which is less secure but the phrase can be remembered as opposed to stored.
