# Non-Encrypted Shares

This mode of mixing will include:

- [Obfuscation](../methods/obfuscation.md)
- [Shamir sharing](../methods/shamir.md)

## Mixing (hiding)

[Mixing](./mixing.md) will obfuscate the seed words and then split them into the specified number of shares.

## Unmixing (recovery)

[Unmixing](./unmixing.md) will take the threshold number of shares and reconstruct the original seed.
