# Ancillaries

SeedMixer provides some ancillary utilities that aren't directly related to the mixing functionality.

## File shredding

Whist not really an issue if you are using [TailsOS](../installation/tailsos.md) (unless using persistent storage), the files generated by seedmixer will be stored locally on disk. This presents a problem on non-secure hosts as the file (or file fragement) may be moved to a trash area rather than fully deleted. Even when fully deleted there may still be a recoverable ghost image of the file stored on the disk. [File shredding](./shredding) provides a method to securely delete files from a file system.

## Word lists

Seed phrases are made up of words selected from the same BIP-39 word list  of 2048 words. Seedmixer provides some methods to check the [word lists] for all supported languages.
