# Intallation

There are three methods of installation/usage: tailos, binaries, and source. The recommended way is using the seedmixer bundled with [TailsOS](https://tails.net/).

If this isn't preferred, the [binaries](./binaries.md) can be downloaded directly from the repo along with the binary hash to check the validity of the binary.

For those 'build from source' people, instructions on building can be found [here](./source.md).
